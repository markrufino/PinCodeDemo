# PinCodeDemo

  A simple demo for adding a "pin code" functionality to your apps. The pin code view is decoupled in such a way that it 
can present itself from any view.

  This is demo #1, the first in a series of demos that I'm planning to put out every week about doing stuff in iOS using Swift. I'll only put it on r/iOSProgamming for the mean time. (The actual 'first' is this -> [#0 - PinchAndZooDemo](https://github.com/markrufino/PinchAndZoomDemo). Hehehe progamming references. /s)

### Objectives of putting out these demos:
1. Create a mini knowledge base for myself and others that might find these useful.
2. Get feedback for improvement purposes.
3. Try out ideas that keep on buzzing in my mind.
