# PinCodeDemo

  A simple demo for adding a "pin code" functionality to your apps. The pin code view is decoupled in such a way that it 
can present itself from any view.

  This is demo #1 (since we are coders, we have [#0](https://github.com/markrufino/PinchAndZoomDemo)), the first in a series 
of demos that I'm planning to put out every week about doing stuff in iOS using Swift. I'll only put it on r/iOSProgamming for the mean time.
